# sol — Solana for Humans and LLM Agents

A command-line tool that lets you work with Solana the way you'd describe it out loud. Pay people, buy and sell tokens, stake, lend, and track your portfolio — instead of constructing transactions and managing program instructions, you say what you want. Keys live locally on disk. No API keys, no private key env vars.

```bash
# Set up
sol wallet create --name "ClawdBot"

# Transfer some SOL to the agent wallet, then:

# Check balance
sol wallet balance

# Swap 50 USDC for BONK
sol token swap 50 usdc bonk

# Stake idle SOL
sol stake new 10

# Deposit USDC to earn yield on Kamino
sol lend deposit 100 usdc

# See everything you hold
sol portfolio

# Snapshot for tracking over time
sol portfolio snapshot --label "post-rebalance"
```

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @solana-compass/cli
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx @solana-compass/cli wallet list
```

Requires Node.js >= 20.

### Install as an Agent Skill

Sol CLI is available as a discoverable skill for Claude Code and other LLM agents:

```bash
# Claude Code — add the marketplace, then install the plugin
/plugin marketplace add solanaguide/solana-cli
/plugin install solana-payments-wallets-trading@solanaguide-solana-cli

# skills.sh
npx skills add solanaguide/solana-cli
```

Once installed, the agent can use Sol commands directly when you ask it to send crypto, trade tokens, check balances, stake, lend, or track portfolio performance.

### First-time setup

```bash
sol config set rpc.url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
sol wallet create
```

Use a dedicated RPC endpoint for production — the public one rate-limits aggressively. Helius, Triton, or QuickNode all offer free tiers.

## Commands

### wallet — Create, import, and manage Solana keypairs

```bash
sol wallet create                             # New wallet, auto-named
sol wallet create --name trading --count 3    # Batch-create 3 wallets
sol wallet list                               # List all wallets with SOL balances
sol wallet balance                            # Full token balances + USD values
sol wallet balance trading                    # Balance for a specific wallet

sol wallet import --solana-cli                # Import from ~/.config/solana/id.json
sol wallet import ./keypair.json --name cold  # Import from file
sol wallet export main                        # Show key file path
sol wallet remove old-wallet                  # Remove from registry

sol wallet set-default trading                 # Change the active wallet
sol wallet label main --add trading           # Tag wallets for organization
sol wallet history                            # Recent transaction activity
sol wallet history --type swap --limit 5      # Filtered
```

Wallets are stored locally as key files. The first wallet created becomes the default for all commands. Change it with `sol wallet set-default <name>`, or override per-command with `--wallet <name-or-address>`.

### token — Prices, swaps, transfers, and account management

```bash
sol token price sol                           # Current SOL price
sol token price sol usdc bonk                 # Multiple prices at once
sol token info bonk                           # Token metadata (mint, decimals)
sol token list                                # All tokens in your wallet
sol token sync                                # Refresh token metadata cache

sol token swap 50 usdc bonk                   # Swap via Jupiter
sol token swap 1.5 sol usdc --slippage 100    # 1% slippage tolerance
sol token swap 50 usdc bonk --quote-only      # Preview without executing

sol token swap 5 usdc sol --wallet backup      # Swap from a specific wallet
sol token send 2 sol GkX...abc                # Send SOL to an address
sol token burn bonk --all                     # Burn all of a token
sol token close --all --yes                   # Close empty accounts, reclaim rent
```

Swaps use Jupiter's aggregator — best price across all Solana DEXes, no API key needed. Every swap is logged with cost-basis prices for portfolio tracking.

### Token resolution

Anywhere a command takes a token, you can use a **symbol** (`sol`, `usdc`, `bonk`) or a **mint address** (`EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`). Resolution works in three steps:

1. **Hardcoded well-known list** — 15 major tokens (SOL, USDC, USDT, JUP, BONK, mSOL, jitoSOL, bSOL, ETH, wBTC, PYTH, JTO, WEN, RNDR, JLP) resolve instantly offline. These are immune to spoofing.

2. **Local cache** — Previously resolved tokens are cached in SQLite with a 24-hour TTL. Populated by prior lookups and `sol token sync`.

3. **Jupiter Token API** — If not cached, the CLI searches Jupiter's token database. Results are ranked by liquidity and trading volume, so `usdc` returns the real USDC — not a scam token with the same symbol. The result is cached for next time.

**For unfamiliar tokens, verify before transacting:**

```bash
sol token info peng                           # Check the resolved mint address
sol token swap 50 usdc EPjFW...1v --quote-only  # Use the mint address directly
```

Using a mint address bypasses symbol search entirely — useful when you know exactly which token you want, or when dealing with tokens that share a ticker. Agents should prefer mint addresses for safety when operating autonomously.

### stake — Native SOL staking with MEV compounding

```bash
sol stake new 10                              # Stake 10 SOL (default: Solana Compass)
sol stake new 5 --validator DPm...xyz         # Stake with a specific validator
sol stake list                                # All stake accounts + claimable MEV
sol stake claim-mev                           # Compound MEV tips (re-stake)
sol stake claim-mev --withdraw                # Withdraw MEV to wallet instead
sol stake withdraw 7gK...abc                  # Smart withdraw (handles deactivation)
```

Creates a stake account, funds it, and delegates — all in a single transaction. The CLI handles the multi-step Solana staking process so you don't have to.

### lend — Lending and borrowing on Kamino Finance

```bash
sol lend rates sol                            # Deposit/borrow APY for SOL
sol lend rates usdc                           # USDC rates

sol lend deposit 100 usdc                     # Deposit USDC to earn yield
sol lend deposit 5 sol                        # Deposit SOL as collateral
sol lend withdraw 50 usdc                     # Partial withdrawal
sol lend withdraw max sol                     # Withdraw entire deposit

sol lend borrow 500 usdc --collateral sol     # Borrow against collateral
sol lend repay 250 usdc                       # Partial repay
sol lend repay max usdc                       # Repay full outstanding debt

sol lend positions                            # All deposits, borrows, health factor
```

Positions include real-time APY, USD values, and health factor monitoring. The CLI warns when health factor drops below 1.1.

### portfolio — Unified view across all positions

```bash
sol portfolio                                 # Everything: tokens, stakes, lending
sol portfolio --wallet trading                # Single wallet view

sol portfolio snapshot                        # Save current state
sol portfolio snapshot --label "pre-trade"    # With a label
sol portfolio history                         # List all snapshots

sol portfolio compare                         # Diff vs latest snapshot
sol portfolio compare 3                       # Diff vs snapshot #3
sol portfolio pnl                             # P&L since first snapshot
sol portfolio pnl --since 5                   # P&L since snapshot #5
```

The portfolio aggregates tokens, staked SOL, and Kamino lending positions across all wallets. Snapshots enable tracking changes over time — useful for agents that need to measure the impact of their actions.

### config — Persistent settings

```bash
sol config set rpc.url https://my-rpc.com     # Set RPC endpoint
sol config get rpc.url                         # Read a value
sol config list                                # Show all settings
sol config path                                # Config file location
```

### Other commands

```bash
sol network                                   # Epoch, TPS, inflation, staking APY
sol tx 4xK9...abc                             # Look up a transaction by signature
```

---

## Structured Output

Every command supports `--json` for automation and scripting:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { "elapsed_ms": 450 }
}
```

Error codes are predictable `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` identifiers (`SWAP_FAILED`, `LEND_DEPOSIT_FAILED`, etc.).

---

## Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Structured JSON output |
| `--rpc <url>` | Override RPC endpoint |
| `--verbose` | Show debug logging |

Most commands also accept `--wallet <name-or-address>` to override the default wallet.

## RPC Resolution

The CLI resolves an RPC endpoint in this order:

1. `--rpc` flag
2. `SOL_RPC_URL` environment variable
3. `~/.sol/config.toml` → `rpc.url`
4. Solana CLI config (`solana config get`)
5. Public mainnet RPC (with warning)

## Data Storage

All data lives in `~/.sol/`:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config.toml` | Configuration (TOML) |
| `data.db` | SQLite — wallets, token cache, transaction log, snapshots |
| `wallets/*.json` | Keypair files (Solana CLI format, chmod 600) |

The transaction log is the source of truth for cost basis and P&L — every swap, transfer, deposit, and withdrawal is recorded with USD prices at the time of execution.

---

## Architecture

- **Runtime**: Node.js (compiled from TypeScript)
- **CLI framework**: commander.js
- **Solana SDK**: `@solana/kit` v2
- **Swaps**: Jupiter REST API (no SDK, no API key)
- **Lending**: Kamino Finance via `@kamino-finance/klend-sdk`
- **Prices**: Jupiter Price API with CoinGecko fallback
- **Database**: SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (WAL mode)
- **Config**: TOML via `smol-toml`

```

  index.ts              # CLI entry point, global flags
  commands/             # One file per command group
  core/                 # Business logic (wallet-manager, swap-service, etc.)

```

## Security

- Key files are plain JSON (Solana CLI compatible), stored with `chmod 600`
- Private keys are never logged or printed to stdout
- `wallet export` returns the file path, not the key contents
- All transactions are logged to SQLite for audit
- Swap commands show quote details before executing

## Permissions

Restrict which operations are available — useful for giving agents limited access (e.g. monitor-only, swap-but-no-transfer). Disabled commands are not registered at all, so they won't appear in `--help`.

Add a `[permissions]` section to `~/.sol/config.toml`. All flags default to `true` (omitted = permitted):

```toml
[permissions]
canTransfer = false
canSwap = false
canStake = false
canWithdrawStake = false
canLend = false
canWithdrawLend = false
canBurn = false
canCreateWallet = false
canRemoveWallet = false
canExportWallet = false
```

| Permission | Gated subcommands |
|---|---|
| `canTransfer` | `token send` |
| `canSwap` | `token swap`, `token close --all` (runtime) |
| `canStake` | `stake new` |
| `canWithdrawStake` | `stake withdraw`, `stake claim-mev` |
| `canLend` | `lend deposit`, `lend borrow` |
| `canWithdrawLend` | `lend withdraw`, `lend repay` |
| `canBurn` | `token burn`, `token close --burn` (runtime) |
| `canCreateWallet` | `wallet create`, `wallet import` |
| `canRemoveWallet` | `wallet remove` |
| `canExportWallet` | `wallet export` |

Permissions can only be set by editing `~/.sol/config.toml` directly — `sol config set permissions.*` is rejected.
